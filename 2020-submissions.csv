The first act of the larp is realistic and the play is limited to the same universe. The second act introduces a surreal element: the computers of the characters undergo an upgrade to a new, quantum version of the operating system, which causes temporary glitches in video calls and gives the characters a brief opportunity to interact with their counterparts from the alternative universe.","family, identity, choices, connection","Freeform larp, Larp, Chat/Message, Streaming/Online Face to Face"
The Fortunate Ones,Ron T Blechner,,"In 2066, AI and human scientists cracked the ability for humans to fully integrate their consciousness to Dotwun (what the Internet evolved into). Humans and fortunae experience differences in how they experience Dotwun, especially in sensory inputs. One player is a human, plugging in to Dotwun for the first time. The other is a fortuna, aiding the human in preparation for “transcending” to digital life in Dotwun.

This game will involve the player of the human to interact with, touch, and sense objects in their real life physical environment, and describe it in detail to the other player. Only the player of the human will have a camera turned on, that both players will look at. Players will communicate through audio. The player of the AI will give instructions to the human player how to interact with the environment, based on a checklist of items that only that AI player will know. Players are likely to succeed, but will face challenges as the two characters will have gaps in communication and differences in how they perceive and sense things.","Transhumanism, neurodiversity, sensory, communication, empathy","Freeform larp, Larp, Chat/Message, Streaming/Online Face to Face"
