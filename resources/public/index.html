It’s also about how MLM companies often operate like cults.

    The game is played over Discord, with a combination of video chats and text chats, using Discord’s roles, permissions and different types of channels to simulate video calls, livestreams, social media, and group chats.

    Each player will be playing a distributor for a multi-level marketing company where most distributors are women. All characters will be connected to ""teams"" according to the ""upline""/""downline"" structure of the company. 

    The scenario of the game is that 3 hours remain in the last day of the month. Each character has a primary goal that they need to achieve by the end of the month. Achieving that goal will generally require exploiting characters beneath them, or characters’ families, friends, and strangers. Characters may have noble goals, but the structure of the company and their own desperation may lead them down a path they aren't proud of.

Feldstein and Matthew Valentine,www.alchemicalgaming.com/games,"Stranded and lost in vast, unfamiliar new worlds, how will you escape and become whole again?  ""Scattered"" is a game about exploration, separation from those we care about, and achieving communal success despite that separation. It incorporates live video chat (with optional text chat “thought bubbles”) for group roleplay, travelogue-based world creation, and sending postal mail for mutual support. This game could be playable for many weeks or months, depending on the challenge level and cycle length chosen by your group. It will generate up to as many worlds as the number of players, worlds that will feel complex and “lived-in” by the game’s end. Perhaps you’ll later use the worlds you create together to run other games, write fiction, inspire new costume and makeup ideas, or for whatever other projects you might imagine.","emergent, cyclical, cooperative, multi-genre","Freeform larp, Larp, Letter Writing, Chat/Message, Streaming/Online Face to Face, Video/Transmedia, Performance, Arts & Crafts"

The first act of the larp is realistic and the play is limited to the same universe.

Humans and fortunae experience differences in how they experience Dotwun, especially in sensory inputs. One player is a human, plugging in to Dotwun for the first time. The other is a fortuna, aiding the human in preparation for “transcending” to digital life in Dotwun.  This game will involve the player of the human to interact with, touch, and sense objects in their real life physical environment, and describe it in detail to the other player. Only the player of the human will have a camera turned on, that both players will look at. Players will communicate through audio. The player of the AI will give instructions to the human player how to interact with the environment, based on a checklist of items that only that AI player will know. Players are likely to succeed, but will face challenges as the two characters will have gaps in communication and differences in how they perceive and sense things.","Transhumanism, neurodiversity, sensory, communication, empathy","Freeform larp, Larp, Chat/Message, Streaming/Online Face to Face"
