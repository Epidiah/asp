The Scarred Land,Chris Dragga and Kate Hill,,"A long time ago--perhaps 100 years ago, perhaps 200--a heinous crime was committed. The passage of time has since erased it from human memory, but the lingering psychic trauma has indelibly scarred the landscape. You always had a strange affinity for this place, but in the past several months, the landscape has begun to haunt your nightmares. You have come to realize that the land is crying out for healing to all of you, the remaining relatives of the victims and the perpetrators. Over the past several weeks, you have found each other and have gathered here to set this right. To this end, you will set out upon the landscape's trails, in search of the scars that most reflect the wounds caused by this crime, mark them on your map, and ritually purify this land. Only then do you have a chance at peace.","hiking, folk horror, nature, map reading, learn a skill",,http://www.goldencobra.org/pdf/2018/Dragga%20and%20Hill%20--%20The%20Scarred%20Land.pdf,
