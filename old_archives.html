It’s also about how MLM companies often operate like cults.

The game is played over Discord, with a combination of video chats and text chats, using Discord’s roles, permissions and different types of channels to simulate video calls, livestreams, social media, and group chats.

Each player will be playing a distributor for a multi-level marketing company where most distributors are women. All characters will be connected to ""teams"" according to the ""upline""/""downline"" structure of the company. 

The scenario of the game is that 3 hours remain in the last day of the month. Each character has a primary goal that they need to achieve by the end of the month. Achieving that goal will generally require exploiting characters beneath them, or characters’ families, friends, and strangers. Characters may have noble goals, but the structure of the company and their own desperation may lead them down a path they aren't proud of.
